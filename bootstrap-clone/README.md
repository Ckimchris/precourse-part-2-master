#Bootstrap Page Challenge!

It's time to build a more complex layout! You'll be building [this website](http://getbootstrap.com/). Again, you should not inspect the page with the developer tools. Do not use any CSS frameworks either, just plain HTML and CSS. If you need to review these languages, this [tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web) will be helpful.

Your understanding of CSS positioning will be tested in doing this, check out [this great guide](http://www.barelyfitz.com/screencast/html-training/css/positioning/) for an awesome guide on CSS Positioning. 

Build this layout and get everything displayed in the right position first before you start adding extensive styling.

##Bonus work

If you want to learn more about CSS frameworks, then you should learn bootstrap, a responsive-design CSS framework. It's documentation can be found on the website you just emulated. However, you may find a tutorial more helpful. This time, rebuild your clone using Bootstrap.

People use bootstrap for lots of different reasons but what really made bootstrap famous was its **Grid** system that makes it easy to  create responsive layouts that look great on multiple different screen sizes.
