# WELCOME TO THE PRECOURSE PART 2!!!

In part 2 of the precourse, you will be doing more JavaScript challenges while building a copy of the "Google" page and a more complex layout as seen on Twitter's "bootstrap" page.

If this is challenging, don't be worried! Getting used to the challenge will be a great asset to you in our program.

## You (STILL) Need To Know How To Use GitHub!

Please refer to the **"How do I get started"** section in [Github.md](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/precourse-part-1/blob/master/GitHub.md#how-do-i-get-started) from precourse-part-1 if you need a refresher on how to fork and clone your repo.

## Style guide

Just like last time, we want you to continue to practice writing clean, readable, consistently styled code. This will make your code more attractive to hirers and it will make other developers more tempted to collaborate with you. Here at Codesmith we follow the [Airbnb styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), a comprehensive and opinionated styleguide for JavaScript. As you work the curriculum, try following the Airbnb styleguide as much as you can. The more you follow it, the more professional your code will look and the easier it will be to show off to potential hirers after Codesmith! You may also install a linting plugin such as [eslint](http://eslint.org/) or [jshint](http://jshint.com/) for your text editor and configure it to follow the Airbnb rules - this way you'll get warnings in your text editor automatically when you don't follow the guidelines.

## Instructions For The Precourse Challenges:

We divided part 2 of the precourse challenges into three sections: [Google Clone](./google-clone), [Fundamentals](./fundamentals), and [Bootstrap Clone](./bootstrap-clone) clone. There are three separate folders for each of the challenges.

During the Google Clone challenge, you will be creating a copy of the "Google" home page using only HTML and CSS. In the Fundamentals challenge, you will be working on solidifying your JavaScript skills even further.

For the Bootstrap Clone challenge, you will be creating a professional layout using only HTML and CSS. Please read the "README.md" files inside the folders for further instructions about each challenge. Be creative with your project and show us that you want to have fun with programming. Good Luck!

## What do I do when I am done?

Please refer to the **"What do I do when I am done with a unit?"** section in [Github.md](https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/precourse-JSFundamentals/blob/master/GitHub.md/#what-do-i-do-when-i-am-done-with-a-unit) from precourse-part-1 if you need a refresher on how to fork and clone your repo.
