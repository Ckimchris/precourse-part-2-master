#Google Clone Challenge!

Today you're going to be building a clone of the Google home page, one of the mostly visited pages in the world. Google itself is a successful company popular for it's highly efficient searched engine built with a meticulous algorithm.

You are going to build this Google page in 2 days (recommended)

This will test:

- HTML
- CSS

##You Will Build

Create the exact replica of the Google Home Page so that if we cannot tell the difference between the original and the copy when we look at it. Remember, you are NOT being asked to implement the functionality of the Google Home Page but only the interface (using HTML and CSS). For this challenge, do not open the chrome developer tools or download the html page. In order to get the most out of this challenge, you should develop the page from scratch.


##Do's and Don'ts

We have an "index.html" file and a "style.css" file, which you will be working on. Do all your HTML works in "index.html" and all your styling (CSS works) in "style.css". DO NOT add any more files or use any JavaScript codes for this challenge. Good Luck!
